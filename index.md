Oluwaleke has excellent communication skills supported by analytical and mentoring skills. He can work autonomously and as part of a team. His biggest assets are his ability to learn quickly, his determination to get things done, his resourcefulness, and his generally positive outlook on life. He approaches tasks both analytically and creatively and enjoys working in an intellectually challenging environment that demands persistence and creativity to succeed. His high work ethic, and eagerness to deliver combined with the maturity of knowing what he wants, make him an ideal colleague.
